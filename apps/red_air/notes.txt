Rainfall Triggering: Look for ANY consecutive lookback_period days (default 3) within the last 14 days where the sum >= rainfall threshold
Status Transitions:
Unknown → Needs Inspection (when rainfall triggers)
Under Threshold → Needs Inspection (when NEW rainfall triggers)
Needs Inspection → Under Threshold (when inspected with numdip < threshold)
Needs Inspection → Needs Treatment (when inspected with numdip >= threshold)
Needs Treatment → Active Treatment (when treated)
Active Treatment → Unknown (when treatment expires)



Check for ANY consecutive N-day period (default 3 days) within last 14 days where sum >= rainfall threshold
SQL: Uses generate_series(0, 14 - lookback_days) to check all possible consecutive periods
